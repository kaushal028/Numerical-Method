# Numerical Methods and Algorithms (Python)

This repository contains Python implementations of numerical methods and algorithms based on my course syllabus. These codes are intended for educational purposes and to aid in understanding key numerical techniques, including:

- Root Finding Techniques
- Solution of Linear and Non-linear Equations
- Interpolation and Extrapolation
- Numerical Integration and Differentiation
- Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Optimization Techniques

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own studies or projects.
